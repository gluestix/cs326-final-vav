# Milestone 1

## Data Interactions

- Crop Data: Since we are localizing for Ahmerst, MA to make this project achievable and are only supporting a set number of crops, we can store a large aggregation of crop growth data to train our predictive algorithm on.
- User Data: User's will be able to login and save crop profiles to their account. Crop profiles will be account specific and contain plant type, acreage, and date planted. Once a crop profile is created, a crop yield curve will be generated using historical crop yield data.

## Wireframes
Our wireframes were designed using whimscal and can be found at [here](https://whimsical.com/website-3DJyuDL2LN7ZT34vvtRyER). The following pages will be created for our application.
