## Overview

According to the American Society of Agronomy, [crop yield prediction remains one of the most challenging tasks in agriculture](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy/special_issues/cropprediction_precisionagriculture#:~:text=Crop%20yield%20prediction%20is%20one,%2C%20environmental%2C%20and%20crop%20parameters.). For a farmer, the benefits of precision agriculture include an increase in crop yield and crop quality which translates to an increase in profits. Existing precision agricultural systems leverage expensive sensing technologies, information systems, and variable rate technologies to maximize crop yield. Our application is a crop growth and yield predictor that leverages weather data, nominal crop growth curves, and date planted to generate a crop yield curve; allowing the farmer to pick the optimal date for harvest and compare visually different crop growing options by overlaying their crop yield curves on top of each other. Our solution is not a replacement for existing systems, but rather a supplemental tool and one that can be leveraged by smaller farmers who may not be able to bear the cost of existing systems.
